		<h2> The Brain Team is Ithaca High School's very own Quiz Bowl team. The team didn't have a logo (or any brand identity) when I joined. I worked with our coach, Mr. Kirk, to create any and all necessary graphics throughout the season. </h2>

		<h2> The team's logo had to a) be identifiable as "Ithaca" for tournaments, b) be identifiable as the "Brain Team" within the school, and c) establish a distinctive aesthetic for the team's overall brand. The final logo is the result of a balancing act between all three criteria. </h2>

		<h2> Ithaca High School hosts a Quiz Bowl tournament every November, and the 2019 tournament featured its own custom logo for the very first time. Autumn colors and geometric shapes worked in unison in to create this branding.</h2>

		<h2> Mr. Kirk's only major gripe with the main logo was that its full-text form could not be used for the team's social media accounts. I condensed the logo into a compact, circular shape to expand our new branding into the cybersphere as well.</h2>

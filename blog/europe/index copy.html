        <p>
            I am writing this on August 6, 2024 — right after the UK’s recent wave of far-right, anti-immigrant riots.

            Such events will only start to become more common in the future, as European populations continue to be riled up against their nations’ liberal immigration policies over the past 30 years.
        </p>
        <p>
            Many news outlets have already voiced their opinions, with Elon Musk warning of a “civil war” while others dramatically proclaimed the “death of Europe.” Even most ordinary people are aware of this at this point.
        </p>
        <p>
            As for myself – I want to take a step back, and offer an Eastern perspective to this entire saga. Watching the UK news, I really couldn’t help but compare recent European events with the slow decline & eventual collapse of the <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qing_dynasty'> Qing Dynasty <i>(1644 - 1911)</i></a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            I’m going to break down the similarities in the following categories, and end up with a list of **predictions** based on these common patterns.

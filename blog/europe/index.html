        <p>
            I am writing this in <b>August 2024</b> — right after the UK’s recent wave of far-right, anti-immigrant riots.

            Such events will only start to become more common in the future, as European populations continue to be riled up against
            their nations’ liberal immigration policies over the past 30 years.
        </p>
        <p>
            Many news outlets have already voiced their opinions, with Elon Musk warning of a “civil war” while others dramatically
            proclaimed the “death of Europe.” Even most ordinary people are aware of this at this point.
        </p>
        <p>
            As for myself – I want to take a step back, and offer an Eastern perspective to this entire saga. Watching the UK news,
            I could not help but compare recent European events with the slow decline (and eventual collapse) of the <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qing_dynasty'> 🐲 Qing Dynasty <i>(1644 - 1911)</i></a> — the end of the Chinese imperial system.
        </p>
        <p>
            More specifically, these riot scenes reminded me of the <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxer_Rebellion'> 🐉 Boxer Rebellion <i>(1899 - 1901)</i></a>,
            a violent anti-foreign and populist uprising. I actually don't think this is a Boxer-level movement yet, just to be clear,
            but there's certainly the possibility that it will eventually lead to something larger.
        </p>
        <p>
            I’m going to break down the similarities in the following categories, and end up with a list of <b> predictions </b> based

           FYI: For the sake of simplicity, I'll be using the term "European Union (EU)" to describe post-WWII Europe in general, starting from around 1950.

        <p> <i>
            I am aware that the EU officially began with the Maastrict Threaty in 1992, but European integration had already been underway since the creation of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) in 1952.

    <p>
        To make this easier to digest, let's put these developments on a chart.
    </p>

    <p> The slow decline and collapse of the Qing Dynasty, as with any other empire, took place in 3 primary stages. For the Qing specifically, most scholars agree that these stages mostly took place in the final <b> 150 years.</b> For the EU, I predict that it will take roughly <b>100 years</b> in total.</p>

        Obviously, these are not exact numerical charts — it's difficult to put a real number on the prosperity of a nation.
        However, I believe they accurately represent the slow 3-stage transition from golden age to collapse.

        If my predictions are correct, this means that we are looking at the final 2-3 decades of a recognizable Europe. The EU itself may still exist by then, but it would be so deeply changed and bruised that it will no longer command the type of authority that it does today.
    </p>

    <p>
        In other words, this may be the start of a few "decades of humiliation" for the European continent as a whole — although it won't be nearly as bad as China was, since Europe will continue to be vibrant in terms of culture and history.

        Of course, one of the benefits of historical literacy is that it allows us to see <i>parallels</i> to our present-day lives.

    <p>
        So with all of that being said, I would like to make <b><u>3 predictions</u></b> about the future of Europe over the next 25 years.

        Some of these events are already starting to materialize, but I've taken the liberty to weave them together into a grand narrative for us to follow.

                "The fall of the Chinese capital to the combined forces of Europe and America marks the end of an era in China. The days of Chinese impunity in the face of Western power are over."

            When the Boxer Rebellion arose, the <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight-Nation_Alliance'> 🇬🇧🇫🇷🇷🇺🇯🇵 Eight-Nation Alliance</a>  <i> (British, French, Japanese, etc.)</i> sent its armies into China to protect its own citizens & reassert their authority.
            This was the moment when China really reached its lowest point, with Western & Japanese troops marching into the capital of Beijing.

        <p>
            Let's emphasize how significant this would be. This means that foreign states would be able to establish semi-colonial stakes in <b>Europe</b> — in the former capitals of colonial empires.
            This is a massive paradigm shift in terms of how we think about the West's place in the world.

            When China was declining, many strange cults tried to restore China to its glory days.
        <p>
        <p>
            Hungry, impoverished peasants were drawn to many strange ideologies, and the Qing court's pathetic incompetence left a vacuum that was filled by radical social & political movements.

        The great decline of Europe will be one of the greatest events of the 21st century, just like the decline of China was in the 19th century.
    </p>

    <p>
        As we all know, the collapse of the Qing Dynasty eventually led to the <a href = ''>🏯 Century of Humiliation</a> — a roughly 120-year period in which
        China was relegated to an impoverished backwater. This period still haunts the Chinese mind, as evidenced by the countless films and series made about
        the exploitation of China by Western powers.
    </p>

    <p>
        This period has also fascinated the Western mind, inspiring classics such as <a href = ''>55 Days at Peking</a> and <a href = ''>The Last Emperor.</a>
        Although clearly viewed from a Western lens, these films capture just how powerless China really was during the turn of the last century.
    </p>

    <p>
        Europe will remain relatively prosperous and free, but its upcoming "Century of Humiliation" may still be quite a sight to behold for the average young European today. However, this one probably will not last nearly a century — only a few decades, at most.
        The modern world simply moves faster than it did in the 1800's.
    </p>

    <p>
        However, this may also give us a glimpse into the future.
    </p>

    <p>
        China did not stay weak forever. After decades of political turmoil, the modern-day <a href = ''>🇨🇳 People's Republic of China</a> arose and eventually lifted China back up into superpower status.

        The PRC represents a <b>resurgent, angry China</b> determined to take revenge on the West for its humiliation, scarred by memories of the past.
    </p>

    <p>
        Could Europe eventually follow a similar path?
    </p>

    <p>
        Now that's a scary thought: a<b> resurgent, angry Europe </b> determined to take revenge.
    </p>

    <p>
        Let's hope we don't live to see that far.
    </p>

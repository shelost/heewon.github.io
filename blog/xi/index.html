        <p>
            I am writing this in <b>September 2024</b>, as the US-China competition is really starting to heat up into dangerous waters.
            The <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election'>🇺🇸 2024 US Election</a> is
            coming up in a few weeks now, and Chinese President <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping'>🇨🇳 Xi Jinping</a> is well
            into his unprecedented third term in office. It seems like the upcoming 4 years <i>(2025 - 2029)</i> are going to be
            the decisive period to determine who will claim global hegemony in the decades to come.
        </p>
        <p>
            Xi is often compared to historical Chinese leaders such as <a href = ''> 🇨🇳 Mao Zedong </a>, <a href = ''> 🇨🇳 Deng Xiaoping</a>, or even ironically
            with the <a href = ''>🐲 Qianlong Emperor</a> for his nationalistic dictatorship. While such comparisons certainly make sense in one respect
            or another, none of them quite had all the ingredients that describe the Xi administration.
        </p>

        <div class = 'list'>

                <p>
                    <b>Mao</b> had a similar nationalistic vision, but his hardline Communist version of China was a weak and poor country that could
                    never play a major role on the world stage.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class = 'row'>
                <img src = '../napoleon/assets/park.png' class = 'portrait' alt = 'Portrait Image'>
                <p>
                    <b>Deng</b> led China to prosperity, but his motto was <i>韬光养晦 (tāo guāng yǎng huì) </i> — "hide your strength and bide your time" —
                    a timid and pacifist policy that Xi would never dream of returning to.

                    <p>
                        <b>Even the emperors of old </b> never had such global ambitions, content as they were with leading an isolated
                        and (in their minds) eternally superior Chinese civilization.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        They simply did not have the will to lead the Chinese nation on a grand mission, despite the fact that they did actually
                        have the capacity to do so (see: the
                        <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ming_treasure_voyages'>👑 Ming treasure voyages</a>).

        <p>
            No, to best understand Xi Jinping's China in 2024, we need to look to another country and period altogether. One in which
            the forces of militant nationalism, rapid economic growth, and a hunger for expansion all coalesced under a powerful leader.
        </p>
        <p>
            I believe that the best forerunner to Xi is in fact <a href = ''>🇩🇪 Otto Von Bismarck <i>(r. 1862 - 1890)</i></a>, the Iron Chancellor of Germany (formerly Prussia).

    <h1 class = 'title'> The Decline, in 2 Charts </h1>
    <div id = 'chart' class = 'anchor'></div>

    <p>
        To make this easier to digest, let's put these developments on a chart.
    </p>

    <p> The slow decline and collapse of the Qing Dynasty, as with any other empire, took place in 3 primary stages. For the Qing specifically, most scholars agree that these stages mostly took place in the final <b> 150 years.</b> For the EU, I predict that it will take roughly <b>100 years</b> in total.</p>



    <ol>
        <li>
            <p> 👑 Golden Age </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p> 📉 Decline</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p> 🪦 Collapse </p>
        </li>
    </ol>


    <p>
        Obviously, these are not exact numerical charts — it's difficult to put a real number on the prosperity of a nation.
        However, I believe they accurately represent the slow 3-stage transition from golden age to collapse.
    </p>

                "The old institutions have become nothing but shackles. The Qing government clings to these shackles,

            </p>

                "Europe is sleepwalking toward oblivion. Without a renewed commitment to unity and democracy,

    <p>
        If my predictions are correct, this means that we are looking at the final 2-3 decades of a recognizable Europe. The EU itself may still exist by then, but it would be so deeply changed and bruised that it will no longer command the type of authority that it does today.
    </p>

    <p>
        In other words, this may be the start of a few "decades of humiliation" for the European continent as a whole — although it won't be nearly as bad as China was, since Europe will continue to be vibrant in terms of culture and history.
    </p>


    <h1 class = 'title'> My Predictions </h1>
    <div id = 'prediction' class = 'anchor'></div>

    <p>
        Of course, one of the benefits of historical literacy is that it allows us to see <i>parallels</i> to our present-day lives.
    </p>

    <p>
        So with all of that being said, I would like to make <b><u>3 predictions</u></b> about the future of Europe over the next 25 years.

        Some of these events are already starting to materialize, but I've taken the liberty to weave them together into a grand narrative for us to follow.

        </p>

        <p>
            Let's emphasize how significant this would be. This means that foreign states would be able to establish semi-colonial stakes in <b>Europe</b> — in the former capitals of colonial empires.
            This is a massive paradigm shift in terms of how we think about the West's place in the world.

            When China was declining, many strange cults tried to restore China to its glory days.
        <p>
        <p>
            Hungry, impoverished peasants were drawn to many strange ideologies, and the Qing court's pathetic incompetence left a vacuum that was filled by radical social & political movements.

            As Europe declines, we're going to see similar radical movements, albeit in a uniquely European cultural context.
        </p>
        <p>
            We're already starting to see glimpses of this throughout the continent — personally, I would keep an eye out for countries like <span>🇮🇹 Italy</span> and <span>🇦🇹 Austria</span>
            for this kind of right-wing violence. These are nations with large immigrant populations (20%+), but with a strong ethno-nationalist culture and history. It may explode all at once.
        </p>
        <p>
            Meanwhile, countries like <span>🇩🇪 Germany</span> or <span>🇬🇧 Britain</span> are usually stronger footholds for left-wing radicalism, since they tend
            to have large wealthy elite classes and generally place a heavy cultural taboo against ethnic nationalism.

        <img src = '../../assets/blog/gallery-2.png' alt = 'Gallery Image'>

        <p>
           When China was declining, the Europeans & Americans enjoyed an unprecedented <b>300-year golden age</b> of invention and discovery.
        </p>
        <p>
            There were definitely major crises during this era — including the <b>French Revolution </b>, the <b>Napoleonic Wars,</b> and the <b>American Civil War</b> </i> — but it was clear that Europe was massively pulling away from all other civilizations on Earth.
            Such crises ended up being <b>"growing pains"</b> that actually helped to elevate Europe's status in the world in the long-term.

    <p>
        The great decline of Europe will be one of the greatest events of the 21st century, just like the decline of China was in the 19th century.
    </p>

    <p>
        As we all know, the collapse of the Qing Dynasty eventually led to the <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_of_humiliation'>🏯 Century of Humiliation <i>(1840 - 1950)</i></a> — a roughly 110-year period in which
        China was relegated to an impoverished backwater. This period still haunts the Chinese mind, as evidenced by the countless films and series made about
        the exploitation of China by Western powers.
    </p>

    <p>
        This period has also fascinated the Western mind, inspiring classics such as <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/55_Days_at_Peking'>🎬 55 Days at Peking <i>(1963)</i></a> and <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Emperor'>🎬 The Last Emperor <i>(1987)</i></a>.
        Although clearly viewed from a Western lens, these films capture just how powerless China really was during the turn of the last century.
    </p>

    <p>
        Europe will remain relatively prosperous and free, but its upcoming "Century of Humiliation" may still be quite a sight to behold for the average young European today.

        The US-China rivalry will continue to dominate the news, with the formerly powerful Europe being relegated to a secondary player in the global landscape.


        One caveat is, this "Century" probably will not last an actual century — only a few decades, at most.
        The modern world simply moves faster than it did in the 1800's.
    </p>

    <p>
        However, this may also give us a glimpse into the future.
    </p>

    <p>
        China did not stay weak forever. After decades of political turmoil, the modern-day <a href = ''>🇨🇳 People's Republic of China</a> arose and eventually lifted China back up into superpower status.

        The PRC represents a <b>resurgent, angry China</b> determined to take revenge on the West for its humiliation, scarred by memories of the past.
    </p>

    <p>
        Could Europe eventually follow a similar path?
    </p>

    <p>
        Now that's a scary thought: a<b> resurgent, angry Europe </b> determined to take revenge.
    </p>

    <p>
        Let's hope we don't live to see that far.
    </p>

    <p>

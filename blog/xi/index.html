        </i></p>

        <p>
            I am writing this in <b>September 2024</b>, as the US-China competition is really starting to heat up into dangerous waters.
            The <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election'>🇺🇸 2024 US Election</a> is
            coming up in a few weeks now, and Chinese President <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping'>🇨🇳 Xi Jinping</a> is well
            into his unprecedented third term in office. It seems like the upcoming 4 years <i>(2025 - 2029)</i> are going to be
            the decisive period to determine who will claim global hegemony in the decades to come.
        </p>
        <p>
            Xi is often compared to historical Chinese leaders such as <a href = ''> 🇨🇳 Mao Zedong </a>, <a href = ''> 🇨🇳 Deng Xiaoping</a>, or even ironically
            with the <a href = ''>🐲 Qianlong Emperor</a> for his nationalistic dictatorship. While such comparisons certainly make sense in one respect
            or another, none of them quite had all the ingredients that describe the Xi administration.
        </p>

        <div class = 'list'>
            <div class = 'row'>
                <img src = 'assets/mao.jpg' class = 'portrait' alt = 'Portrait Image'>
                <p>
                    <b>Mao</b> had a similar nationalistic vision, but his hardline Communist version of China was a weak and poor country that could
                    never play a major role on the world stage.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class = 'row'>
                <img src = 'assets/deng.jpg' class = 'portrait' alt = 'Portrait Image'>
                <p>
                    <b>Deng</b> led China to prosperity, but his motto was <i>韬光养晦 (tāo guāng yǎng huì) </i> — "hide your strength and bide your time" —
                    a timid and pacifist policy that Xi would never dream of returning to.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class = 'row'>
                <img src = 'assets/qianlong.png' class = 'portrait' alt = 'Portrait Image'>
                <div class = 'text'>
                    <p>
                        <b>Even the emperors of old </b> never had such global ambitions, content as they were with leading an isolated
                        and (in their minds) eternally superior Chinese civilization.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        They simply did not have the will to lead the Chinese nation on a grand mission, despite the fact that they did actually
                        have the capacity to do so (see: the
                        <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ming_treasure_voyages'>👑 Ming treasure voyages</a>).

        <p>
            No, to best understand Xi Jinping's China in 2024, we need to look to another country and period altogether. One in which
            the forces of militant nationalism, rapid economic growth, and a hunger for expansion all coalesced under a powerful leader.
        </p>
        <p>
            I believe that the best forerunner to Xi is in fact <a href = ''>🇩🇪 Otto Von Bismarck <i>(r. 1862 - 1890)</i></a>, the Iron Chancellor of Germany (formerly Prussia).

        If my predictions are correct, this means that we are looking at the final 2-3 decades of a recognizable Europe. The EU itself may still exist by then, but it would be so deeply changed and bruised that it will no longer command the type of authority that it does today.

            When the Panic of 1873 hit Germany, the <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Democratic_Party_of_Germany'>🌹 Social Democratic Party</a> was formed to push for workers' rights and compensation.

            Bismarck initially suppressed the SPD with the <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Socialist_Laws'>🇩🇪 Anti-Socialist Laws</a> — only to eventually realize that the German people's frustration
            could not be contained, and shifted to actually introduce <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Socialism_(Germany)'>🇩🇪 State Socialism</a> policies in order to protect his authority.

            <b>🔮 I predict</b> that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) will introduce a series of welfare reforms & social safety nets in order to stabilize society.
        </p>

        <p>
            Xi Jinping has previously denounced what he calls "welfarism" which breeds laziness among the people. While an ironic statement to say the least, coming from the leader
            of a supposed "Communist" party, this matches Bismarck's initial reluctance to introduce serious reforms.
        </p>

        <p>
            However, as the Chinese people's frustrations begin to mount, some kind of state-sponsored relief would greatly aid the CCP's grip on authority.

            When the Panic of 1873 hit Germany, Bismarck finally decided that Germany had to expand outwards in search of new markets & political influence.
        <p>
        <p>
            The German people were filled with nationalistic fervor, and the new government was hungry to flex its newfound strength overseas. Although existing
            European powers had already taken most of the "easy" targets, Germany still managed to form the third-largest empire during that time (after Britain and France).

    <p>
        China is still the future for now, even though it's facing big problems at the moment.
    </p>

    <p>
        As we all know, Germany never quite achieved its 20<sup>th</sup>-century dream of displacing Anglo-American hegemony to become the world's dominant power.
        The grand world-conquering visions of <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_II'>🤴🏻 Wilhelm II <i>(r. 1888 - 1918)</i></a> and
        <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler'>👨🏻 Adolf Hitler <i>(r. 1933 - 1945)</i> </a> both ultimately failed,
        leaving Germany relegated to being a continental land nation, rather than a world superpower.
    </p>

    <p>
        However, Bismarck's greatest achievement — the <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unification_of_Germany'>unification</a> and <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrialization_in_Germany'>industrialization</a> of the modern German state — still goes down in history as
        one of the most significant events of the 19<sup>th</sup> century.
    </p>

    <p>
        Germany is still the most powerful nation in the EU, the <i>de facto</i> leader of the European continent, and the 3<sup>rd</sup> or 4<sup>th</sup> largest economy in the world.
        Bismarck's dream of a powerful Germany continues to live on, even though not quite in the form that he may have imagined.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>As of late 2024</b>, all signs indicate that Chairman Xi's China will follow a similar path.
    </p>

    <p>
        China will likely never <i>completely</i> replace the United States in terms of global influence, nor is it obvious that this is what the CCP leadership
        even truly wants. America's overwhelming geographical advantage aside, I am not sure if any <b>"Old World"</b> power will be able to overtake the US
        anytime in the next few decades.
    </p>

    <p>
        However, Xi's greatest achievenment — the <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_China'>unification</a> and <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_economic_reform'>industrialization</a> of the modern Chinese state — is bound to
        go down as perhaps the most significant event of the 21<sup>st</sup> century.
    </p>

    <p>
        But that opens up another horrifying possibility — now that the stage is set, will we see a <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I'>World War I</a>-level catastrophic event in East Asia?
    </p>

    <p>
        Once again, let's pray we don't live to see that far.
